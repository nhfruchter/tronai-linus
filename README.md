The world's best AI competition. Seriously.

Write an AI in Python (or your language of choice). Extend the AIBase class, implement the play() function (which should return a wasd direction) to get started in Python.

Helpful things the base class implements:

* board state
* predefined PLAYER, OPPONENT, EMPTY, and FULL variables
* predefined LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN, and VECTOR_MAP variables
* a wasd to vector function called vectorize()
* findToken() to find a token on the board
* findLegal(), pretty self explanatory

Go for it.
